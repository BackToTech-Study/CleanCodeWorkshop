# CleanCodeWorkshop
Share ideas and recommendations for clean implementations

## The basics
### Reduce complexity as much as possible <=> Don't make your life harder than it needs to be.
### Your code should be as easy to read as a newspaper.
Code is like a joke. If you have to explain it it's bad.
### Keep configuration data away from the source code.
### Favor polymorphism to if/else cascade or switch/case
### Make your code testable by using dependency injection
### Limit dependencies. Avoid side effects. See the concept of pure functions.
### Single goal <=> Do one thing <=> Change for a single reason.

## Code smells
### Rigidity. The software is difficult to change. A small change causes a cascade of subsequent changes.
### Fragility. The software breaks in many places due to a single change.
### Immobility. You cannot reuse parts of the code in other projects because of involved risks and high effort.
### Needless Repetition.
### The code is hard to understand.
### Needless Complexity.

## SOLID

## Design Patterns
### Observer
### Command
### MVC
